Dataset used in this project are downloaded from the project workspace


Libraries used for this project:

Spark SQL, Spark ML, Datetime  

Project file structure:

Sparkify_V1.ipynb - Initial Model and Solution  

Sparkify_V2.ipynb - Updated solution (added new attributes, visuals and changed model setup as detailed in the blog)


This project demonstrates a general data science project work flow, from problem definition, business/data understanding, to data preparing/modeling and results/deployment.

Based on this analysis, factors that are important for predicting user based churn behavior are mostly directly related to user experience, such as up-vote count, error page encounter count, paid status and thumb down count. Other weaker predictors are gender, and observed life time.
